      <h2>How the system works</h2>

      <h3>The big picture</h3>
      <p>
      YaST consists of several pieces that work together despite being distributed
      among several packages and repositories. In order to be proficient in YaST
      development, it's crucial to understand what is the role of every component,
      how they relate to each other and where they live in the GitHub
      infrastructure. That is explained in the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/architecture/">YaST
      architecture</a> document.
      </p>

      <p>
      That complex system is translated into files and folders in a consistent way all
      along the full set of YaST repositories and therefore in the
      installed system, as detailed in the
      <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST:_Code_Organization">YaST code
      organization description</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessing YaST subsystems from Ruby </h3>
      <p>
      The core system of YaST is implemented using a mixture of languages, but the
      whole functionality is easily accessible from Ruby, the language used to
      implement almost all modules. The
      <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-ruby-bindings/">documentation
      of YaST Ruby bindings</a> contains comprehensive information not only about
      the way to access SCR or WFM from Ruby, but also about the legacy modes used
      during the transition from the YCP language to Ruby, like Ops or Builtins.
      </p>

      <h3>Basic libraries</h3>
      <p>
      YaST provides a basic API to access several aspects of a
      Linux system configuration, from network to packages management and from
      hardware status to systemd. YaST basic libraries provide access to that
      API and to several YaST specific mechanisms and concepts. Full documentation can
      be found on the <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-yast2/">yast-yast2 page
      on Rubydoc</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Agents</h3>
      <p>
      At lowest layers, almost every operation in YaST relies on one or several
      agents. The <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-core/tree/master/doc">
      GitHub of yast-core</a> documents the full range of agents that are
      available through the SCR interface.
      </p>

      <h3>Graphical interface</h3>
      <p>
      YaST interface relies on libYUI, an engine that provides abstraction from
      graphical user interfaces (Qt, Gtk) and text based user interfaces (ncurses).
      The YaST code interacts with the underlying libYUI system through the
      <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-ycp-ui-bindings">UI bindings</a>. Some
      <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-ruby-bindings/blob/master/src/ruby/yast/ui_shortcuts.rb">shortcuts
      </a> are provided by the abovementioned Ruby bindings in order to make the usage
      of UI bindings even more straightforward.
      </p>

      <p>
      Even if libYUI is used through the very convenient wrappers, the
      <a href="http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/YaST/openSUSE11.3/tdg/Book-UIReference.html">UI
      reference documentation</a> and the
      <a href="http://doc.opensuse.org/projects/YaST/openSUSE11.3/tdg/Book-YCPUIlayout.html">UI
      layouts and events guide</a> from the original C++ API are still the best
      sources of information to know how every class and method works under the hood.
      Currently there is also new experimental on the fly generated documentation for this
      <a href="http://yast-ui-bindings.surge.sh/">API</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>The installation process</h3>
      <p>
      YaST is not only the Swiss Army knife of Linux configuration, it's also a very
      flexible and configurable installer used in all versions of openSUSE and SUSE
      Linux. In order to understand how the different pieces interact
      during the installation process, from Linuxrc to the final steps of
      installation, including configuration proposals or partitioner, it's highly
      recommended to read the
      <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-installation/">documentation of the
      yast-installation module</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Tutorial</h3>
      <p>
      Those willing to take their first steps into YaST development can follow
      the tutorial titled
      &quot;<a href="http://yast.github.io/yast-journalctl-tutorial/">creating
      the YaST journalctl module</a>&quot;. The document, targeted to developers
      with no prior experience with YaST, presents a very simple example of a
      YaST module developed from scratch and provides a good overview of the
      YaST architecture and development tools. 
      </p>

      <h3>Tips &amp; tricks</h3>
      <p>
      When developing or debugging YaST, there are several gotchas that can be
      extremely useful. Some of them are not only targeted to developers but also to
      users and are collected in the
      <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:YaST_tricks">YaST tricks page</a> at the
      openSUSE wiki.
      </p>

      <p>
      In addition to those tricks, you can find several bits of useful information in
      the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development-tips/">YaST
      development tips and tricks</a> document.
