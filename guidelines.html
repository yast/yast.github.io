      <h3>Contribution guidelines</h3>
      <p>
      YaST is an open source project and as such it welcomes all kinds of
      contributions. If you want to report a bug or contribute
      some code, make sure you read the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing/">YaST
      contribution guidelines</a> first.
      </p>

      <p>When contributing code, it should go through the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/code-review/">documented
      code review process</a>. That means, among other things, that all new code
      must be reviewed. YaST follows the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/rubocop/">Ruby
      style guide</a> for the source code and its own
      <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST_style_guide">UI style guide</a>.
      Code needs to be automatically tested, so new tests should follow
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/how-to-write-tests/">guidelines
      for writing tests</a>.
      The preferred documentation format in code is YARD, learn more in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/chetan/1827484">this cheatsheet</a> and
      in its <a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/Tags.md">thorough
      explanation</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>From the repository to the distribution</h3>
      <p>
      YaST honors the &quot;release early, release often&quot; principle with a
      continuous integration (known as CI) infrastructure. Every time new
      code is merged into the master branch of a YaST repository, the CI server
      automatically handles all the packaging tasks and ensures that the package
      is sent to openSUSE Factory. The process is described in depth in
      <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST:_Development_Workflow">this page
      of the openSUSE wiki</a>.</p>

      <p>The development of a new version of a Linux distribution does not stop when
      the distribution is published. In order to create a maintenance update,
      some steps are required in addition to merging the fix into the right branch.
      These steps are described at
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/maintenance-branches/">The
      &quot;Maintenance Branches&quot; document</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Continuous testing with Travis CI</h3>
      <p>
      <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> is used for running tests during development.
      It runs the tests for every pushed change and when a pull request is created. The build result
      is visible at GitHub so build or test failures can be found out very early.
      More details can be found on
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/travis-integration/">
      the Travis Integration documentation.</a>.
