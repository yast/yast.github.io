## New blog for Agama! {#agama-blog}

Recently we started a [new documentation site](https://agama-project.github.io/)
for Agama. After some discussions we decided to also start the Agama related
blog there as well to avoid confusion between YaST and Agama. Since now we use
this blog only for the YaST related posts, for the Agama news check the new
place. We also imported the old Agama related posts from this YaST blog so you
can find everything at one place.

So where you can find the new blog? It is here!

Enjoy! :jack_o_lantern:

## Agama version 10 {#agama-10}

And to give you one more reason to look at the new Agama blog we have just
published the [Agama version 10](
https://agama-project.github.io/blog/2024/10/30/agama-10) blog post there!
:wink:
