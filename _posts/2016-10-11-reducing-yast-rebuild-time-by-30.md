Here comes the YaST team again trying to flood your aggregator with blog
post! Now it’s time for the story of how we reduced the critical path of
the rebuild time of YaST RPM packages from 42min 2s to 29min 40s.

## Chapter 1: where to optimize

Of course, the first step to start fixing something is finding out what
exactly needs to be fixed. In our case, this breaks down into

1.  knowing the dependencies, and
2.  knowing the individual build times.

### Dependencies

It is tempting to figure out the dependencies by yourself, by parsing
the spec files. But it is hard to do right, and, more importantly, a
reinvention of the wheel. The Build Service must know all this to be
able to schedule the builds, and provides a convenient way to access it,
with `osc dependson`\:

```
$ osc dependson YaST:Head openSUSE_Factory x86_64
[...]
yast2-x11 :
   yast2-devtools
yast2-xml :
   yast2-core
   yast2-devtools
yast2-ycp-ui-bindings :
   libyui
   yast2-core
   yast2-devtools
```

### Individual build times

For each source package, the Build Service produces not only binary RPMs
but also a `_statistics` file, available in the [web UI][1] or via `osc
getbinaries`. We were interested in the total build time, although the
data was of limited use because packages can be built on machines with
vastly different power and this information is not included.

## Chapter 2: how to optimize

Once we knew which screws needed to be tightened, it was time to do it.
Fortunately we had more than one tool for the job.

### Stop using Autotools

Autotools (automake, autoconf and configure) took up a majority of the
time needed for building YaST packages. Now that most of those packages
are written in pure Ruby, we don’t need autotools there checking for
portability problems that we don’t have. Autotools are a leftover from
the times 15 years back when they were the only sensible option. We
[have wiped them out][2] where possible and have been [switching][3] to
our own [set of Rake tasks][4].

### Stub the APIs used in tests

We run a mixture of unit and integration tests at RPM build time. The
downside of this is that we pull in many of the run time dependencies.
Fortunately Ruby is a dynamic language and makes it easy to replace
interfaces by stubs. That enables us to cut those dependencies.

In fact, we also have some Perl code, notably in yast2-users. Although
the stubbing techniques across languages are messier than with pure
ruby, they are still effective for our purposes.

### Do not build specialized documentation

This one is simple: if the development documentation is only useful for
people that will check out the git repo anyway, then leave it out from
the RPM.

## Appendix: the details

Enough of high-level explanations, we we promised you graphs, code and
all kind of gory details, and a promise made is a debt unpaid. So there
we go.

### Dependency graphs

A picture is worth a thousand words. That’s why we came up with [this
small tool][5] to generate a graphical representation of the
dependencies of the YaST packages. In the resulting graphs displayed
below, a node is a source package in the build service, and an arrow
means “needs for its build”. Redundant arrows are omitted (that is,
we’ve erased an A→C if both A→B and B→C existed).

We can see that the most prominent conclusion is that there is a large
number of packages that depend on yast2, a collection of basic
libraries.

But on top of that, in the original graph there are 6 more layers, and
the graph is not very dense there. After our fixes, there are only 4
layers that are more dense.

Is worth mentioning that the “layer” concept only works if the packages
take roughly the same time to build; it would not be helpful if there
were huge variations. To get a more accurate picture, we should have
generated a histogram of build times. But the graph was good enough in
our scenario… and we had to stop the analysis at some point.
:simple_smile:

The build dependency graph before our fixes:

{% include blog_img.md alt="YaST dependencies graph (before)"
src="yast_deps_before-248x300.png" full_img="yast_deps_before.png" %}

The build dependency graph after our fixes:

{% include blog_img.md alt="YaST dependencies graph (after)"
src="yast_deps_after-184x300.png" full_img="yast_deps_after.png" %}

### Build statistics

If those graph are not geeky enough for you, here you are the detailed
build statistics from the build service

```xml
<buildstatistics>
  <disk>
    <usage>
      <size unit="M">1118</size>
      <io_requests>15578</io_requests>
      <io_sectors>2156642</io_sectors>
    </usage>
  </disk>
  <memory>
    <usage>      <size unit="M">580</size> </usage>
  </memory>
  <times>
    <total>      <time unit="s">756</time> </total>         <!-- THIS -->
    <preinstall> <time unit="s">8</time>   </preinstall>
    <install>    <time unit="s">72</time>  </install>
    <main>       <time unit="s">555</time> </main>
    <download>   <time unit="s">4</time>   </download>
  </times>
  <download>
    <size unit="k">33564</size>
    <binaries>53</binaries>
    <cachehits>24</cachehits>
    <preinstallimage>preinstallimage.preinstallimage.tar.gz</preinstallimage>
  </download>
</buildstatistics>
```

## Epilogue

This was definitely an interesting journey. We learned quite some
things. Specially we learned that there is still room for improvement,
but most likely the time reduction will not pay off for the time
invested implementing those improvements.

We have to be realistic and keep working in other interesting stuff to
fuel the next sprint report, coming next week!
