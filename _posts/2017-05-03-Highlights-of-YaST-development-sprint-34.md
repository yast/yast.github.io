## Introduction

### Just a Template

- This is just a template file for collecting the text for the
  [team blog](https://lizards.opensuse.org/).
- Whenever you finish something worth mentioning in the blog just add a new entry
- The text will be reviewed and polished before publishing, this is just to collect
  the input from the developers. So be focused on the technical side, the wording,
  grammar, etc... will be improved later :wink:

### How to Write

- Adapt the YAML header as needed. See the [list of already used tags](http://yast.github.io/blog/tags),
  but feel free to add a new one if needed.
- See the [documentation](https://yast.github.io/blog/how_to_write) for more details.
- It is a good idea to add a link to Trello card, bugzilla or a GitHub PR for the reference
  (it will not be published in the final text but it will make the review or changes
  easier).

### Preview

- You can check the preview [here (TODO)], please note that currently we are still
  using the [lizards.o.o](https://lizards.opensuse.org/) site for the blog,
  the text will be copied and published there in the end.
