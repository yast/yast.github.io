## How to Contact the YaST Developers

The YaST is as open source project and the developers communicate in an open
way using mailing lists or IRC.

### The YaST Mailing List

You can contact the YaST team at the [openSUSE `yast-devel` mailing list](
mailto:yast-devel@opensuse.org).

The [mailing list archive](https://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/)
can be used to look up the older posts.

### The YaST IRC Channel

Use the `#yast` channel at the `freenode.net` server. You can also join via
the [web interface](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23yast).

The best time to use IRC is usually between 9-18 hours CET. During weekends
or public holidays most of the team members are away.

### Reporting Bugs

If you want to report a bug use the [Bugzilla](
https://bugzilla.suse.com/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided&product=openSUSE+Factory&component=YaST2)
bug tracking system.
