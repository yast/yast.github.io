[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/yastgithubio/badge/?version=latest)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/yastgithubio/?badge=latest)


Repository to host the YaST landing page (http://yast.github.io) and some
general YaST documentation. This is still in work in progress, so please
take a look to the [TODO.txt](TODO.txt) file to see where your help is needed.

YaST is a complex project spread over a big amount of repositories in Github.
The main goal of the page is to provide a clear view of the whole project at a
central point for both users and developers, but with a stronger focus in the
later.

Since the source code if spread over several repositories following an
organization that (almost always) makes sense, there is no reason to centralize
the documentation of that source code. Therefore the goal is not to offer a
central source of information, but a starting point that aggregates links
to the sources of information (whenever are they maintained by the
developers) in a way that makes sense and is easy to digest for newcomers.

Beside the files of the landing page itself, there is also a ```doc``` directory
with documentation targeted to developers and that are related to the project as
a whole and, as such, does not completely fit in any of the source code
repositories.
