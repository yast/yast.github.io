      <h2>How to contribute to YaST</h2>

      <h3>1. Meet others involved</h3>
      <p>YaST is a worldwide project with people from many nations and cultures
      contributing to a common purpose â€“ Making YaST Linux's predominant
      all-purpose computing tool. The fastest way to get in contact is
      to simply show up in the <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org/">#yast</a>
      IRC channel at irc.opensuse.org (freenode). Most YaST developers
      will be there willing to help and answer any question.<p>

      <p>You can also reach most developers and follow the development in the
      <b>yast-devel@opensuse.org</b> mailing list; 
      <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:yast-devel+subscribe@opensuse.org">subscribe</a>
      to it, take a look at the
      <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/">archives</a> or
      request a mail offering
      <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:yast-devel+help@opensuse.org">help with the mailinglist</a>.

      <h3>2. Get the code</h3>

      <p>YaST is a complex system consisting in several components and modules. You
      can find them all in the <a href="http://github.com/yast">YaST organization</a>
      at GitHub. Most components are written in Ruby with a high level of abstraction and
      with some core components handling the graphical stack written in C.
      There are still some small legacy parts written in Perl or YCP (YaST Control
      Programming language), but they are being ported to Ruby.
      </p>

      <p>
      There are more than 100 YaST repositories at GitHub.
      If locating the right one is a problem, let RPM tell you the source package:
      </p>
      <pre>
$ rpm -qf --qf '%{SOURCERPM} (%{NVRA})\n' /usr/share/YaST2/scrconf/etc_idmapd_conf.scr
yast2-nfs-server-3.0.0-6.2.src.rpm (yast2-nfs-common-3.0.0-6.2.noarch)</pre>
      <p>
      From that, <b>yast2</b>-nfs-server is found in the repository
      <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-nfs-server"><b>yast</b>-nfs-server</a>
      (note the digit is not present).
      </p>

      <p>The only exceptions are the <code>yast2.rpm</code> package, with code is located in the
      <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-yast2">yast-yast2</a> repository and the
      <code>autoyast2.rpm</code> package, which code can be found in the
      <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-autoinstallation">yast-autoinstallation</a> repository.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Take the first steps</h3>

      <p>In order to start improving YaST, you need to setup a development
      environment. Up-to-date instructions can be found in the
      <a href="http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/">
      development documentation</a>.</p>

      <p>After preparing the development environment and cloning the desired
      yast module in git, all the rake tasks provided by
      <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-rake">yast-rake</a> will be
      available from your working copy of the repository.</p>

      <p>The first step to fixing or improving any application is to understand how
      it works and what it is doing at every moment. The openSUSE wiki
      has a <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:YaST_debugging">comprehensive
      guide</a> about debugging YaST.</p>
